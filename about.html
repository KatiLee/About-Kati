    <p>Hello! My name is Kati.</p>
    <p> I am from Iowa, even though I was born in a hospital in Nebraska.</p>
    <p>My parents lived in Council Bluffs, so my mom delivered me in Omaha and we drove home across the bridge! Next they moved to 
        Tipton for five years, which was an interesting growing experience within such a small town. When my mom got a job at a high school 
    in Cedar Rapids we gave up small town living for the bright lights of the big city.</p>
